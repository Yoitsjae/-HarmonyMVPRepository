Rating: 8/10
Explanation: This week, our team made significant progress towards completing the MVP for Harmony. We successfully integrated the front-end and back-end components, allowing users to register, log in, and search for recommended songs based on their preferences. The core functionalities, as outlined in our project plan, are now implemented and operational.
Completed as Planned:
User registration and authentication system
Song recommendation algorithm integration
Search functionality for finding recommended songs
Incomplete Aspects:
User profile customization features
Integration of additional external APIs for enhanced song recommendations
Implementation of real-time chat support for user interaction
Challenges:
Technical Challenge:
The most challenging technical aspect we encountered this week was optimizing the performance of our recommendation algorithm. We faced difficulties in fine-tuning the algorithm parameters to ensure accurate and relevant song suggestions. Through iterative testing and adjustments, we were able to achieve satisfactory results, but it required considerable effort and experimentation.
Non-Technical Challenge:
One of the most significant non-technical challenges we faced was managing team coordination and communication effectively. As we progressed towards completing the MVP, coordinating tasks and ensuring alignment among team members became increasingly complex. We addressed this challenge by scheduling regular sync-ups and utilizing project management tools to track progress and assignments.
